* [OC-670] Remove registry/configuration components and replace gateway with Ngnix 
   -  removes infra services;
   -  use Nginx as web server and reverse proxy;
   -  change configuration from web-ui.yml to web-ui.json;
   -  authentication configuration located into nginx conf files (default.conf in docker-compose environment);
   -  replace or complete the web-ui.json of your docker-compose environment with your backed-up file;
   -  to use ng serve with deploy docker-compose, use default-web-dev.conf instead of default.conf.


IMPORTANT:
BEFORE UPGRADING
save a copy of your web-ui.json to back-up custom changes.

_When working on branch `develop`, the `deploy` docker-compose will rely on `SNAPSHOT` docker images generated daily.
This lets you test OperatorFabric with the latest merged code. If you're interested in running a particular release on
the other hand, you should checkout the associated X.X.X.RELEASE tag on `master`. The same is true for the
`dev-environment` docker-compose._
