== Features

== Tasks

- OC-1283 : Allow external config location for docker-compose
+
This can be useful to avoid comitting test or demo-specific configuration. See https://opfab.github.io/documentation/archives/2.1.0.RELEASE/docs/single_page_doc.html#_specify_an_external_configuration[documentation]
- OC-1361 : Remove old notification feature via the browser
- OC-1407 : Remove detailTitle in bundle config -> the title of the card always came from the title field of the card 
- OC-1427 : Minor updates to release process doc
- OC-1409 : When pushing the process group file check for duplicate process
- OC-1429 : Update documentation for reviewer
- OC-1191 : Replace lib ng2-table by ag-grid in admin
+
NOTE: This entailed a few changes to the design of the screen.
- OC-1430 : Adapt api testing script
- OC-1405 : Fix Sonar Quality Gate
- OC-1437 : Make AOT compilation the default for ng build

- OC-1061 : Upgrade Angular from v8.2 to v10.2
+
NOTE: This shouldn't have any impact for deployments using docker. If you need to build the UI however, you need to run "npm install" first to get the new dependencies. We found it best to delete the node_modules folder before running npm_install to avoid errors. In addition, see the https://opfab.github.io/documentation/archives/2.1.0.RELEASE/docs/single_page_doc.html#_build[documentation] to troubleshoot any errors.
- OC-1468 : Addressing CommonJs dependencies warnings
- OC-1083 : Refactoring of ngnix endpoints for groups and entities : "/users/entities" instead of "/entities" and "/users/groups" instead of "/groups"
- OC-1457 : Admin : Do not limit size of input field
