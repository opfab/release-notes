= Version SNAPSHOT

== Overview

We decided to make this a major version because in addition to providing new features, it also substantially changes (and hopefully improves!) the user experience (*new global style for the UI* and layout changes for some screens).

The following features introduced as beta in previous versions are now *production-ready*: 

- User Cards
- Agenda
- Logging
- Monitoring

This version also introduces a *notification filter management* interface for users (see below for details).

== Features

- *Filter notification screen for user* (OC-1218, OC-1219, OC-1275, OC-1360): users can now filter the card they received in the feed with a configuration screen accessible throught the right menu 
- *Events representation in time* (OC-1241, OC-1242, OC-1299): handle repeating events & remove bubble for business period end.
- [OC-1229] Send card to user using group of entities
- [OC-1272] Add the possibility to show ack button only if action is disabled for the user. In consequence, the configuration of the acknowledgement feature has changed (link:https://opfab.github.io/documentation/current/docs/single_page_doc.html#_migration_guide_from_release_1_8_0_to_release_2_0_0[see migration documentation]).
- [OC-1277] Add the possibility to set business menu visibility depending on group membership (link:https://opfab.github.io/documentation/current/reference_doc/#menu_entries[see documentation])
- [OC-1289] Do not show child cards on the UI archive panel
- [OC-1200] Add update reponse button when there is already a reponse for the entity
- *User cards (Free Message)* (OC-1279, OC-1295, OC-1195): feature enhancement and changes to the card-sending form
